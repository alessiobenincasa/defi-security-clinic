# Security Recommendations

## Fundamental Problem
The SideEntranceLenderPool contract uses the same ETH pool for two different functionalities (deposits and flash loans) with different but non-isolated accounting systems.

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Separate lending and deposit pools
```solidity
contract SecureLenderPool {
    mapping (address => uint256) private deposits;
    uint256 private flashLoanPool;
    
    function deposit() external payable {
        deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw() external {
        uint256 amount = deposits[msg.sender];
        deposits[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.sendValue(amount);
    }
    
    function addToFlashLoanPool() external payable {
        flashLoanPool += msg.value;
    }
    
    function flashLoan(uint256 amount) external {
        require(flashLoanPool >= amount, "Not enough in flash loan pool");
        uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
        
        IFlashLoanEtherReceiver(msg.sender).execute{value: amount}();
        
        require(address(this).balance >= balanceBefore, "Flash loan not repaid");
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: Verify the repayment source
```solidity
function flashLoan(uint256 amount) external {
    uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
    
    // Capture balances before
    uint256 borrowerBalanceBefore = balances[msg.sender];
    
    IFlashLoanEtherReceiver(msg.sender).execute{value: amount}();
    
    // Verify that the borrower's balance hasn't changed
    require(balances[msg.sender] == borrowerBalanceBefore, 
            "Cannot deposit during flash loan");
            
    require(address(this).balance >= balanceBefore, 
            "Flash loan hasn't been paid back");
}
```

### Solution 3: Use separate accounting for repayment
```solidity
function flashLoan(uint256 amount) external {
    uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
    
    IFlashLoanEtherReceiver(msg.sender).execute{value: amount}();
    
    // Verify that repayment is made directly and not via deposit
    require(address(this).balance >= balanceBefore, 
            "Flash loan hasn't been paid back");
            
    // Block access to deposit during a flashloan
    require(!inFlashLoan, "Cannot deposit during flashloan");
}
```

## Secure Design Principles
- **Separation of concerns**: Different functionalities should have separate accounting systems
- **Access control during critical operations**: Limit what can be done during a flash loan
- **State tracking**: Keep track of ongoing operations to prevent unauthorized interactions
- **Complete verifications**: Don't just check the final state, but also the intermediate operations
- **Principle of least privilege**: Limit possible actions during sensitive operations
