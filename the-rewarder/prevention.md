# The Rewarder - Prevention Techniques

## Short-Term Fixes

### Time-Weighted Position Tracking
Implement a time-weighted accounting system that measures not just token balances but also the duration they've been held:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) private depositTimestamps;

function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
    // Record deposit time
    depositTimestamps[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
    // Rest of the deposit logic
}
```

### Minimum Holding Period
Require users to hold tokens for a minimum period before being eligible for rewards:
```solidity
function distributeRewards() external {
    require(
        block.timestamp >= depositTimestamps[msg.sender] + minimumHoldingPeriod,
        "Holding period not satisfied"
    );
    // Rest of the reward distribution logic
}
```

## Long-Term Solutions

### Vesting-Based Rewards
Implement a vesting mechanism where rewards must be claimed over time, preventing flash loan attacks:
```solidity
function claimRewards() external {
    uint256 pendingRewards = calculatePendingRewards(msg.sender);
    uint256 vestedAmount = calculateVestedAmount(pendingRewards, depositTimestamps[msg.sender]);
    
    rewardToken.transfer(msg.sender, vestedAmount);
}
```

### Reward Snapshots with Decay
Take multiple balance snapshots over time with a decay function that values longer-term deposits more highly:
```solidity
function calculateRewards(address user) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalScore = 0;
    
    for (uint i = 0; i < snapshotCount; i++) {
        totalScore += balanceSnapshots[user][i] * decayFactor(i);
    }
    
    return totalScore * rewardRate;
}
```

## Monitoring and Governance

### Analytics and Alerts
- Implement alerts for unusual deposit-withdrawal patterns
- Monitor for large balance changes occurring in single transactions
- Track flash loan interactions with the reward pool

### Protocol Governance
- Regular security audits focusing on economic attacks
- Community monitoring of reward distributions
- Gradual release of new reward mechanisms with caps on maximum rewards
